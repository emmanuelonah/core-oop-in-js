# Core OOP in JavaScript - 1st Edition
# Preface

Welcome to the 1st edition of *Core OOP in JS* eBook.

If you've read the first [publication](https://codesandbox.io/s/core-javascript-object-oriented-programming-dmmov?file=/docs/read-me.md:1839-1844), be rest assured this is better formatted.

If this is your first time reading these book, I'm glad you're here. Prepare for a deep and extensive journey into all the corners of OOP in JavaScript.

## The Mission

My mission with **Core OOP in JS** is to empower every single JS developer to fully understand how object oriented programming works in JavaScript.

Before the es6 class, we could implement OOP to the fullest, so this book is here to show you all of those patterns without using an es6 syntax. The benefit of this; is that, while you write es6 OOP you will have a full understanding of whats going on behind the hood.

The knowledge in this book will also help you work in legacy codebase.

## The Path

This book is minimal, read it according to your pace but most importantly, make sure you are enjoying and understanding each chapter of the book.

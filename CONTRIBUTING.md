# Contributing

Please feel free to contribute to the quality of this content by submitting PR's for improvements to code snippets, explanations, etc. If there's any doubt or if you think that a word/phrase is used confusingly, **before submitting a PR, open an issue to ask about it.**

However, if you choose to contribute content (not just typo corrections) to this repo, you agree that you're giving me a non-exclusive license to use that content for the book, as I (and my publisher) deem appropriate. You probably guessed that already, but I just wanted to be extra clear on that.

## Editions

The current edition of the books is the 1st edition.

## Typos?

If you're going to submit a PR for typo fixes, please be measured in doing so by collecting several small changes into a single PR (in separate commits).

## Search First!

Also, if you have any questions or concerns, please make sure to search the issues (both open and closed!) first, to keep the churn of issues to a minimum. I want to keep my focus on writing these books as much as possible.
